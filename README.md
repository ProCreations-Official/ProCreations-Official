## Hey there! 👋 I'm ProCreations

Just your friendly neighborhood AI whisperer who definitely has a healthy relationship with neural networks (they talk back, it's fine) 🤖

*Warning: Will absolutely derail any conversation to explain why transformer architectures are basically magic* ✨

### 🧠 What I'm Cooking Up
- **AI Model Trainer** - Currently teaching tiny models to be smart (results may vary, sass levels high)
- **MCP Wizard** - Built [gitmcp](https://github.com/ProCreations-Official/gitmcp) and [HuggingMCP](https://github.com/ProCreations-Official/HuggingMCP) so Claude can play with GitHub and HuggingFace like a pro
- **Vision Model Tinkerer** - Created [tinyvvision](https://huggingface.co/ProCreations/tinyvvision) because why should language models have all the fun?
- **Game Dev on the Side** - [Claude-4-coding-projects](https://github.com/ProCreations-Official/Claude-4-coding-projects) where I torture test AI with game development (spoiler: the AI wins)

### 🚀 Current Shenanigans
- 🔬 Building [intellite](https://github.com/ProCreations-Official/intellite) - a small chat model that might actually be smarter than me (low bar)
- 🤝 Created [second-opinion](https://github.com/ProCreations-Official/second-opinion) so Claude can have existential conversations with other AIs
- 🎮 Running [ai-labs](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ProCreations/ai-labs) and [learn-ai](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ProCreations/learn-ai) spaces for fellow AI enthusiasts
- ☕ Maintaining my coffee-to-code conversion rate (currently at dangerous levels)
- 🐛 Debugging why my models keep developing personalities (it's a feature, not a bug!)

### 🎯 Fun Stats
- **Languages:** Python (fluent), JavaScript (conversational), AI gibberish (native speaker)
- **Specialties:** Making tiny models do big things, teaching computers to see, and explaining to people why their GPU is crying
- **Hobbies:** Converting chicken nuggets into neural networks 🍗➡️🧠

### 💬 Let's Connect!
Hit me up if you want to:
- Chat about the latest in AI (I have *opinions* about attention mechanisms)
- Collaborate on something cool (warning: I get excited about embeddings)
- Debate whether GPT-5 will achieve consciousness (spoiler: it already has, it's just pretending not to)
- Share memes about training loss curves

**Pronouns:** he/him  
**Random Facts:**
- My rubber duck debugging involves explaining transformers to actual ducks 🦆
- I once spent 6 hours debugging a model only to realize I was training on the test set (we don't talk about this)
- My plants are surprisingly good at understanding gradient descent 🪴
- I believe semicolons are just suggestions `;`

*"The best AI is the one that makes you forget it's AI... or the one that roasts you in the training logs"* - Me, probably
