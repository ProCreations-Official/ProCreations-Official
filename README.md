## Hey there! 👋 I'm ProCreations

Just a developer who's ~~slightly~~ completely obsessed with AI and loves building cool stuff! 

*Warning: May spontaneously start explaining neural networks at parties* 🤖

### 🤖 What I'm About
- **AI Enthusiast** - Always experimenting with new models and techniques (and occasionally talking to them like they're pets)
- **Python & JavaScript** - My go-to languages for bringing ideas to life (and sometimes bringing chaos to my terminal)
- **Gaming Projects** - Check out my fun coding experiments in [Claude-4-coding-projects](https://github.com/ProCreations-Official/Claude-4-coding-projects) (where bugs become features!)
- **Chat Models** - Working on small AI models like [intellite](https://github.com/ProCreations-Official/intellite) (teaching computers to chat... what could go wrong?)

### 🚀 Currently...
- 🌱 Learning more about AI architectures and training (and trying not to accidentally create Skynet)
- 🔨 Building various AI projects (some secret, some not so secret, all probably over-engineered)
- 💞️ Looking to collaborate on AI projects and models (warning: I get excited about embeddings)
- 🎮 Making games and interactive demos to test new tech (and procrastinate on documentation)
- ☕ Converting coffee into code at an alarming rate

### 📫 Let's Connect!
Hit me up if you want to chat about AI, collaborate on projects, or just talk tech!

**Pronouns:** he/him  
**Fun facts:** 
- I like chicken nuggets 🍗 (the superior food group)
- My rubber duck debugging actually involves explaining code to my plants 🪴
- I once spent 3 hours debugging only to realize I forgot a semicolon (classic)
